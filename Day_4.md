Day 4. **How to Choose the Right Product**:
  * Product Metrics & Criteria
    1. Price - $19 - 50
      * If price below 19, it can make sense if the margins are good
    2. Lightweight - < 2lbs
    3. BSR - < 6000
    4. 500 or less reviews
    5. Listing Quality - can I optimize it?
    * **Do this 10 to 20 products and compile a list. This list should give you several product ideas**

  * The Math
    * 1x10x10 Strategy
    * 1 product, 10 sales per day, $10 unit  profit
    * $100 profit per day
    * $3000 per month!
    * 5 products = $500 per day
    * $15000 per month!

  * Choosing a product
    1. Start with keyword search
    2. Look at each product and review the Product Metrics above
      * Look at some Key Values: (Product Name, Price, Weight, Size, ASIN, Top Level Category Only, # of Reviews)
      * Is it optimized?
        1. Check title
        2. FBA or Merchant (easier to compete with merchant)
        3. Bullet Points
        4. Description
      * Create a spreadsheet:
        * Product, ASIN + link, BSR, Reviews, Price, Listing Quality (1-5)
        * Check sales history on camelcamelcamel.com
