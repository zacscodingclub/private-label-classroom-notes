Day 2. **How To Use Amazon & Sell Products**:
  * What is Amazon FBA?
    1. You ship product to Amazon warehouses
    2. Amazon picks and packs those products
    3. They ship to your customer
    4. They handle customer service

  * Three Types of Product Sources
    1. Wholesale
    2. Retail/Online Arbitrage
    3. Private Label

  * Problems with Wholesale & Arbitrage
    1. Usually selling brand names (other people in on the game)
    2. You don't own the product (can't own the buy box)
    3. Anyone can sell it! (same UPC)
    4. Share the buy box

  * Private Label Benefits
    1. Own the product
    2. Customize product
    3. Customize packaging
    4. Own buy box
