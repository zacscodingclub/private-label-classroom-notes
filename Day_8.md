Day 8.: ** Launch Phase **
# Let's get the ball rolling!

* Feed Amazon What They Want 
* Sales and Reviews
* Ranking for Keywords
Note: Reviews = Conversions or Sales

* Receiving First Sales & Reviews
  1. Contact friends/family, ask for "an honest review"
  2. Post Giveaway Offer to FB or Email list (apparently the average is ~50% reviews on giveaways)
  3. Use other lists or Tomoson.com
  4. Plan to giveaway 50 to 100 units at $1.95
  5. If you're giving out 100 units, try to spread them out so there are 20 per day over 5 days.  This will provide a spike in sales in BSR.  Consistency is good for # sales.

  * Bonus Tip:  Auto Follow-Up
    1. Manually follow-up with customers
    2. Collect Seller Feedback & Reviews
    3. On Delivery - 2 Days Later - 7 Days Later
      * Just wanted to check in, saw you received.  We'd appreciate if you give us feedback "we're a small business."
    4. Use 3rd party tool to automate (salesbacker)

* Reviews
  * Unverified
    1. Unknown where they bought it
    2. It's fine since it will still provide stars on the listing, but there is a small Unverified label

  * Verified
    1. Bought product on Amazon

  * Step 1 - Create Base of Reviews (social proof)
  * Step 2 - Create Organic Reviews (PPC)
  * In the beginning, you're looking for ANY review.  You want the social proof to help receive natural, organic sales then turn on Amazon PPC

* Goals for this Phase
  1. Receive Initial Base Reviews
  2. Receive Sales Through Giveaways
  3. Spike Sales to Increase BSR
