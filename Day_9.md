  3. Run for 7 Days then Pause - Run Report
  4. Look at Keywords that Amazon Targeted - Impressions - Clicks - Sales
    * Impressions - Showed up that many times (you don't pay for impressions, just clicks)
    * Amazon sales can often be slow to report, sometimes 3-4 day lag
  5. Create NEW Campaign using Good Keywords (Sales - Clicks)
    * Same CPC.  If impressions low, CPC too low.
    * Might start at $3 for 1 day to see how many total impressions you'll get.  Then you dial it back to see how that changes as you go down.
  6. Same Daily Budget - Look at Impressions - If Low Increase Bids
