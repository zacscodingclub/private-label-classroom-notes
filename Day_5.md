        Hi, my name is Zac and I'm the purchasing agent for Best Beach Goods.

        We are in the process of adding a few WIDGETS to our product line and your product seems to be what we are looking for.

        I have a few questions.

        1. Do you offer samples and how much including DHL Express Shipping to United States zip code 32408?
        2. How long to receive 2 samples?
        3. Can we pay using Paypal?
        4. Can we change the color?
        5. Can we brand with our logo?
        6. What is the cost per unit including shipping by DHL Air Express to United States zip code 32408?
        7. How long for manufacturing once we place order?
        8. Do you accept Escrow payments?

        Our first order of 500 will be a small test order and in the future we will be ordering between 1,000 and 5,000 units.

        Can we order 500 units for the first order?

        We are looking forward to hearing from you soon.

        Thank you!
